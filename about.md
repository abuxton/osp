A community driven and promoted collection fo projects, driven by various communities with varying levels of dedication and seriousness.

* Noob Climbing (noobclimbing.co.uk)[http://noobclimbing.co.uk] (http://noob.onsightproductions.co.uk), a firmly tongue in cheek look at the climbing world, tshirts, art, climbing and sloths! 
* Red Circle Games (redcirclegames.co.uk)[http://redcirclegames.co.uk] (htp:://rcg.onsightproductions.co.uk), a thoughtful collection of ideas concerning LaRP and RPG'. 
* What ever next?, that's a question not a project and that should give you an idea what this site is about!
